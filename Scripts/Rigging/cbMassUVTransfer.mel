Why?_
I got tired of selecting, transferring, reselecting, tranferring..
and so on and so forth...
//----------------------------------------------------------

How?_
Place the cbMassUVTransfer.mel file in your Maya scripts
directory, source the file (or reboot Maya) and run

cbMassUVTransfer();

I have also included an icon for shelf usage.
( cbMassUVTransferShelfIcon.bmp )

Shelfbutton example:

source "C://Documents and Settings//userName//My Documents//maya//X.X//scripts//cbMassUVTransfer.mel";
cbMassUVTransfer();
//----------------------------------------------------------
