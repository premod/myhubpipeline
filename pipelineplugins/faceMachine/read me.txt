Thank you for purchasing The Face Machine!

Once the Face Machine plug-in is installed, you'll need to tell Maya to load it by following these steps:

1) Run Maya.

2) Go to the Windows menu. Choose Settings/Preferences, then Plug-in Manager.

3) Find "FaceMachine.mll" in the plug-ins list. The list is in alphabetical order, so you may need to scroll down.

4) Click the "loaded" and "auto load" checkboxes next to "FaceMachine.mll"

5) Enter your serial number when prompted. You should receive your serial number within 24 hours of your order. If not, please contact janet@anzovin.com.

The Face Machine menu will appear. For more information on using The Face Machine, go to this menu, choose "About" and then "Documentation."
